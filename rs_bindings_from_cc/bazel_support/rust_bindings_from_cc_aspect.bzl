    # So, rust_cc_proto_library_aspect + rust_cc_proto_library_aspect + cc_proto_aspect are all
    # attached to dependencies through `rust_library.cc_deps` attribute.

    # cc_proto_aspect implicitly depends on C++ Protobuf runtime library through its `_cc_lib`
    # attribute. Transitively, the runtime depends on //third_party/absl. //third_party/absl is also
    # depended on by other paths in the build graph.
    #
    # `_cc_lib` is the root of the problem. We're asking Bazel to attach cc_proto_aspect onto an
    # implicit dependency of itself. That's a dependency cycle. Bazel
    # solves it by silently removing cc_proto_aspect from the set of aspects, and attaching this
    # smaller set onto `_cc_lib`` transitively. In our example (and almost always in large builds),
    # there are multiple paths through the dependency graph of the target through some
    # cc_proto_library, and without a cc_proto_library, that land at a common foundational libraries
    # such as absl. So, Bazel will generate 2 shadow targets for absl. One with 3 aspects, one with
    # 2 aspects.
    #
    # This is quite a pickle on so many levels, but most immediately this results in action
    # conflicts as rust_bindings_from_cc_aspect - it registers exactly the same binding generation
    # actions for the shadow target for 2 aspects and for the shadow target for 3 aspects.
    #
    # The fix, ugly as it is, is to check if cc_proto_aspect is present in the aspect ids. If not,
    # we are in the shadow target for 2 aspects, and we can return early. This is only possible
    # because:
    # 1. We don't need Crubit bindings for `_cc_lib` for protobuf interop, we use protoc for that.
