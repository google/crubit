/// categories like "integer", "sse2", or "memory".  Classification impacts how
/// a given value is passed (e.g. by value in `eax` or `xmm0` register, or by
/// pointer).  ABI classification of C++ structs generated
/// by `cc_bindings_from_rs` needs to match exactly the classification of the
/// Rust structs in the input crate (e.g. from this test).  Mismatched ABI
/// classification will lead to Undefined Behavior.
///
/// This is a regression test for b/270454629 - replacing fields with an opaque
/// blob of bytes (e.g. using `[u8; N]` instead of the actual field type) may
/// change the ABI classification of a struct.  The fields of structs below are
/// private (i.e. non-`pub`) to encourage `cc_bindings_from_rs` to treat them as
/// an opaque blob of bytes.
///
/// Optimizing compiler can make the disassembly of the `create` methods quite
/// empty (probably because the input argument uses the same register as the
/// return value.  To make the tests more sensitive to ABI choices, the
/// `multiply` method is used (to actually operate on the input arguments and to
