# Are we Crubit Yet?

NOTE: The bug links below, of the form `b/123456`, are for Google-internal
tracking purposes.

What follows is an overview of the major features Crubit does and does not
support. The list is necessarily incomplete, because there exist more features
and types than could be feasibly listed in anything readable, but it should give
a rough idea.

This page should evolve over time:

*   If the status of a given feature is not listed, and not clear based on what
    *is* here, we should add it.
*   Some features may not have bug IDs attached. If a feature is actively
    requested, it should be listed with a given bug that updates will be posted
    to.
*   This page may fall out of date, since the set of features supported by
    Crubit is documented in many places. Sorry! Please update it if you notice
    any problems.

## Types

See <internal link>/types for more details about types in general, including
explanations of what it means for a type to be ABI-compatible versus
layout-compatible.

Unless otherwise specified, the types below are supported and ABI-compatible
(see <internal link>/types/primitive, <internal link>/types/pointer):

*   integer types (except 128-bit integers)
*   floating point types
*   user-defined types
    *   These are either layout-compatible (usually) or ABI-compatible (rarely â€“
        if all member types are supported, and it's nonempty, and it uses no
        obscure attributes)
*   function pointers, where the parameters and return type are in this list and
    are ABI-compatible
*   `std::string_view` / `absl::string_view`
*   Bridged: `std::string`
*   Bridged: `&str`
*   Bridged: Rust tuples (e.g. `(i32, i64)`)
*   raw pointers to any ABI-compatible or layout-compatible item in this list

We have *experimental* unreleased support for the following types:

*   (2025H2) b/362475441: references and pointers to `MaybeUninit<T>`, which are
    treated as `T`.

We have planned support for the following types:

*   (2025H1) b/308406733: bridged protocol buffers
*   (2025H1) b/356221625: bridged `absl::Status`, `absl::StatusOr`
*   (2025H2) b/271016831: layout-compatible `*const [T]`, `*mut [T]`
*   (2025) `Option<T>` and `std::optional<T>`.
*   (2025) b/356221873: bridged `std::vector`

The following types are **not** yet supported, among many others:

*   b/254507801: Rust `!`
*   b/260128806: Arrays (`std::array<T, N>`, `[T; N]`)
*   b/254094650: `i128` and `u128`
*   Rust `String`
*   `Result<T, E>`
*   b/254099023: `()` as anything but a return type.
*   b/213960614: `std::byte`

## C++

For C++ libraries, used from Rust, we have support for the following **language
features**, used in public interfaces:

*   rust-movable structs. (Either trivially copyable, or
    `[[clang::trivial_abi]]`)
*   rust-movable unions.
*   enums
*   type aliases
*   non-overloaded functions (which are **not** member functions)
    *   inline or non-inline
    *   extern "C" or non-extern "C"

We have *experimental* unreleased support for the following language features:

*   forward declarations
*   non-trivial types
*   b/356224404: non-overloaded member functions, (overloaded) constructors and
    assignment operators
*   templated types, bridged to a non-generic concrete type.
    *   e.g. `vector<int>` becomes `struct __crubit_mangled_vector_i`, not
        `struct vector<T>(...)`
    *   specialization
*   operator overloading
*   nullability annotations
*   lifetime annotations, mapped unsafely to references
*   Some object-orientation:
    *   types with **non-virtual** base classes
    *   upcasting
    *   downcasting
    *   inherited methods

The following features are **not** supported yet, among many others:

*   b/213280424: overloading
*   b/313733992: Object-Oriented Programming more generally
    *   e.g., cannot derive from a C++ class and override its virtual methods
*   *safe* support for references
*   template-generic bridging, so that a C++ template becomes a Rust generic
*   non-type `using` aliases
    *   using enum
    *   using namespace
*   constants
*   macros

## Rust

For Rust libraries, used from C++, we have support for the following language
features, used in public interfaces:

*   structs
*   `repr(C)` unions
*   opaque representations of other user-defined types
    *   enums
    *   non-repr(C) unions
*   aliases (via `use`, `type`)
*   functions and methods
*   references in functions, provided that mutable aliasing is impossible
*   specific known traits with equivalents in C++:
    *   `Clone`
    *   `Default`
    *   `Drop`
    *   `From`
*   simple `const` constants
*   Defining a C++ enum from Rust

We have *experimental* unreleased support for the following language features:

*   unsafe use of references, such as two `&mut` references in the same function
*   non-opaque enums
*   non-opaque non-`repr(C)` unions

The following features are **not** supported yet, among others:

*   traits and trait methods in general
*   defining C++ abstractions from Rust
    *   inheriting from a C++ class
    *   defining a C++ base class
*   statics and more complex `const` constants
*   macros

## Build System

We currently only support Bazel.
