# Create a loader/trampoline repository that we can call into to load LLVM.
#
# Our real goal is to choose between two different sources for LLVM binaries:
#  - if `LLVM_INSTALL_PATH` is in the environment, we treat it as the root of
#    an LLVM installation and try to use headers and libraries from there
#  - otherwise, we build LLVM from source
#
# We *could* implement this choice directly as an if/else between `http_archive`
# or `new_local_repository`. However, all Bazel `load`s are unconditional, so we
# would always end up cloning the (very large) LLVM project repository to load
# its Bazel configuration even if we aren't going to use it.
#
# To avoid that, we add the extra indirection of the "loader" repository. We
# populate the loader repository with one of two templated .bzl files depending
# on whether we want "local" or "remote" LLVM. Then our caller activates that
# .bzl file and gets the desired effect.
